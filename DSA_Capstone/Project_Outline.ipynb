    "> **What are the impacts of sex offender residence restrictions?**\n",

    "To do this, we must first break the question down into actionable elements, then conduct the data science lifecyle until we reach suitable answers. Our actionable elements will be: \n",
    "\n",
    ">**Q1:** How much livable residential space does this provide for sex offenders to legally reside in relation to the overall residential area of the same region?\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Q2:** Do the residential restrictions result in any cost of living (housing) impacts?\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Q3:** Are there any persons currently on the sex offender registry who may be in violation of the special consideration restrictions?\n",

    "1. Limit to the City of St. Louis, MO  \n",
    "2. Utilize free, open source, and publicly-available data  \n",

    "    - City zoning/parcel geometry  \n",
    "    - Sex offender registry   \n",
    "    - Property values/assessment results  \n",
    "3. Work in Python with a PostGIS database  "
